# RL-Ping-Pong
 
Ping Pong Goal is a fast-paced, competitive game where players try to stop their opponent's ball and score a goal. In this version of the game, AI-powered agents are used to challenge players, utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to improve their strategies and decision-making.


The goal of the game is simple: prevent the opponent's ball from crossing your side of the screen while trying to score by sending the ball past your opponent. The game is played on a traditional ping pong-style table with two paddles on opposite sides.

Controls
Player 1: Move the paddle up or down using the arrow keys.
Player 2 (AI): Controlled by an AI agent.
AI-Powered Opponent
The AI opponent uses Deep Q-Learning (DQL), a type of reinforcement learning, to make decisions. The AI continuously learns and adapts its strategy based on the game environment, improving over time. It aims to predict the most optimal actions based on the current state of the game (e.g., ball position, paddle position, etc.).

AI and Learning Method:
Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. In this game, the AI learns by receiving rewards for actions that bring it closer to winning (e.g., stopping the ball or scoring a goal) and penalties for actions that bring it closer to losing (e.g., missing the ball).

Deep Q-Learning (DQL)
Deep Q-Learning is an advanced version of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function. The AI agent uses this network to predict the value of future actions in a given state. Over time, it refines these predictions based on experiences and game outcomes, gradually improving its ability to play against human players.
